# Doggiegram
Doggiegram is an app that allows users to collect and share photos of their favorite dog breeds.

Users can:
* Add a new photo to the collection
* Remove a photo from the collection
* Search and filter the photos collection based on a search term
* Load a photo suggestion that the user can add to their collection

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting the App

The page will reload when you make changes.\
